# Cloud-Based Sales Data Warehouse & BI Analytics Platform

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end cloud data engineering pipeline that transforms raw sales data into a structured analytical data warehouse using star schema modeling.

The solution simulates a production-style environment by integrating AWS infrastructure, ETL processing, relational data modeling, query optimization, and business intelligence reporting.

It demonstrates practical skills in cloud computing, data engineering, database optimization, and analytics dashboard development.

## 🗄 Data Warehouse Design

### Fact Table
- `fact_sales` – transactional sales data

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_product`
- `dim_region`
- `dim_payment`
- `dim_date`

### Optimization & Integrity
- Indexed foreign keys for faster join performance
- Composite indexing for date-based regional analysis
- Enforced referential integrity via foreign key constraints
- Created `monthly_revenue` view for optimized reporting
